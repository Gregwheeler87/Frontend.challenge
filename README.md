# Frontend.challenge
An assignment in the Bloc Design Program to code the bus routes view for the app BusyBus.

# Role/Tasks
I was given the routes and arrival frequency of each bus that services the Washington and State bus stop. My goal was to code a list-view design that incorporated the guidelines for the chosen platform and the visual styling I designed in the visual challenge.
